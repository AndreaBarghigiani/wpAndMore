WordPress Theme for wpAndMore project. 

Jump on http://wpandmore.info and have a chat with me, Andrea Barghigiani, about your passion for WordPress!

I love hear from you! First and foremost because that will help me develop even more content for my website. 
What? Did you not know that I am constantly creating guide and courses to let you learn more about WordPress!

And second because I would love to know more about you. How and When you met WordPress, why you love it, how deep are your knowledge of this platform and, why not, interview you on a Skype call to let my audience know even more about you! 

Why should you start to read my Blog? (Or even get in contact with me for that matter) 

Because inside my site you'll find my knowledge of WordPress categorized in three family, just to let you choose what to know and when:

	Use - the first family (the yoellow pencil) that you can choose to read from is the one that will teach you how to USE WordPress. How to start to use your fresh installation of this platform, learn how publish your articles, which plugins I advice you to use and even how to start your business with WordPress;
	Dev - this is my favourite one, the orange pencile! As I met WordPress looking for something that will help me develop amazing website, this could be your family too. If you love use WordPress to build up your next project, if you enjoy create new plugins that will help thousand of people and making some money out of it in this family are collected courses and articles to let you discover WordPress even more deeply. Jump in to have some advanced WordPress training for free!
	Help - the last family, the blue pencil, is the one that will show you how to find help; you can choose to contact me directly or look for answers on some of the WordPress comunities that I will link to.

All sounds like lot's of fun, well, will be even more fun if I'll got the chance to meet you and know your story. 
Anyway, I hope that you will enjoy my content and I desire even that you'll get something out from it! For that reason I'll give to you my own template!

Since I developed it starting from the Bones Template, I will release it with the same licence of Eddie Machado, and you can do whathever you want with it.
You can use as a starter theme for one of your project, you can learn how I use WordPress from my code or you can even create a better theme!

The only thing that I would like you to do form me it's just speak about my project to your friends and colleagues, because you'll not only help me, but also all your contact will benefit from it; as long as they want to use WordPress :D
